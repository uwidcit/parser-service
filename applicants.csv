RE: UWI DCIT Internship 2021 Application Form
Dear Department of Computer & Information Technology, 
My willingness to learn and the development of my technical skills are the main reason I would like to be chosen for this programme. 

As a student living on campus, I have been involved in my university community by developing my leadership, communication and interpersonal skills. I have been involved in many events and activities, including being a representative for my Faculty's Student Council, being a class representative for a few of my classes and participating in activities at my dormitory, on Freedom Hall. Throughout these experiences, it allowed me to develop strong time management skills and organizational skills.

I have been motivated enough to also have some real work experiences. I previously work at subway as a Sandwich Artist, Movie Towne C3 as an Arcade Attendant and The Institution of International Relations as a Student Assistant. 

Running an Instagram food blog, listening to music, playing of videogames and leisure exercising are some of my personal hobbies I engaged in. I have also developed skills such as using Microsoft Office, Video Editing, Graphic Design and learning about PC hardware on my own personal time as well. 

I believe that I have a lot to offer to any organization, if I am chosen for this internship programme. I look forward to discussing my application at the interview stage. I have enclosed a copy of my resume, passport size photo and transcript for your consideration. Please don't be afraid to contact me at any time. The details are provided above. 

Thank you for reading my cover letter. 

Yours Respectfully 
David Prime

Regarding the prospective internship, I hereby apply for a placement in the Computer Science Internship program. I strongly believe that my enthusiasm and commitment to excellence make me the ideal candidate for this position. 
In terms of my academic achievements, I am in my third year of my B.Sc. in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of the West Indies.

In this program, I am particularly interested in computer programming and I constantly search for opportunities to learn new skills. I am hoping that this application would provide me with the rare opportunity to grow in this field while contributing positively to the company’s goals.
In terms of my work experience, I have worked in various voluntary positions, developing critical thinking skills and a strong work ethic. For example, I worked as a science and mathematics tutor with the Sixth Formers’ Association in 2016. This position allowed me to pass on the knowledge I have gained by mentoring my peers. At A.S.J.A. Girls’ College, I was also the House Captain and a member of the Mathematics Club, Student Council, Cancer Society, and Badminton Club. 
Through these various experiences, I have developed a track record of integrity, maintaining high standards, and becoming proficient in new skills in record time. Whether I work independently or as part of a team, I exhibit professionalism with an innate ability to thrive under pressure. I also have excellent written and oral communication skills. 
In conclusion, I believe that the combination of my academic qualifications and work experience provide me with the skillset and competencies which are ideal for this internship. I, therefore, submit my resume for your perusal and I wish to thank you in advance for your consideration.

I am submitting my resume for consideration for an internship at your company. Given the skills and experience outlined in my resume, and my attitude and willingness to adapt to new environments, I believe I will be a worthy candidate to fulfil this role.

I spent the past six years volunteering my time with The Autistic Society of Trinidad and Tobago where I planned activities and events, aided in supervision and guidance of neurodiverse persons and organized the supply room in a more efficient manner. I have also participated at The Student Volunteer Programme where I spent time with ill children, providing them with entertainment and helping nurses with small tasks when requested.

In addition, my collective working experience has taught me time management and organizational skills due to having to split my time and attention between overlapping tasks and creating more efficient systems that made finding information easier. It has also helped me improve on my verbal and written communication, customer service and ability to take initiative.

I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team. This internship would help me grow my real-world experience in the technology industry and help me to further develop and gain new skills.

I am writing today in application to the DCIT Internship programme. I believe that my problem solving ability, logic and reasoning skills, ability to work in fast paced environments and ability to work well in teams would serve as significant assets to this programme.
Currently, I am pursuing a joint major in Mathematics and Computer Science. I possess a GPA of 4.12 and have been on the dean’s honour roll for the academic year of 2019/2020. In addition to this, I am a registered tutor at UEL aiding both secondary and tertiary students within the field of my degree.
For the past three years, I have worked as a sales associate at a business every Christmas, where i acquired skills in working as a team as well as working under pressure and in a timely manner. This came from having to work with customers and my coworkers on a daily basis, ensuring the delivery of quality service. I believe these skills will be a great asset in this programme. My responsibilities at this job also allowed me to develop crucial communication skills as I was required to be able to interact with both customers to provide excellent customer service as well as with my coworkers to fulfill the objectives of the business.
Throughout the years I have developed skill in various programming languages such as Java, C, C++, Python and Lua. I applied these skills to various small projects in Graphical Interfaces and Game Development. These projects highlight my initiative and greatly enhanced key skills in problem solving as well as logic and reasoning. I believe that this experience in working on individual projects will benefit these companies for this programme.
In addition, I also volunteered at the Advanced Learning Academy where I tutored primary school students. This allowed me to not only harness my leadership skills  but also pass on my current knowledge to youths in the community and contribute to my country in a manner that would serve to benefit the development of the wider society.
I believe that this program will offer both challenges and opportunities to further expand my skill set. As an honors student currently pursuing a joint major that requires high levels of critical thinking and problem solving skills, I also possess great skills in performing all my tasks in both an organized and timely manner. Throughout the years I have spent in school, I developed a great drive towards my work, always ensuring that all required tasks were completed and taking different perspectives and approaches to a problem that needed to be solved.  My persistence and dedication are other significant assets of mine that will benefit these companies as there is yet a problem that I have encountered that has not been solved. 
I take a structured approach to completing my tasks, planning the steps needed to achieve a particular goal while still being able to quickly reassess the situation when unforeseen circumstances occur. Hence, I believe that this internship will not only expand my skill set but will also expose me to various scenarios inside the workplace, giving me significant experience that will aid in future endeavors
Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you consider my application as I am looking forward to learning more details about the internship position and participating companies.

Dear Sir/Madam,
 
My name is Akeel Henry, and I am writing to apply for the DCIT 2021 internship programme. Having successfully completed the last internship programme, I must say it was one of the best experiences of my academic life. Unfortunately, it was not the full 12 weeks like I had hoped because of the pandemic, but still, it is an experience I will never forget. However, knowing that I was fortunate enough to be chosen for the last programme, I will be happy with whatever option I can get. It will help me to gain more experience in the field, something which I definitely need. 
I am looking to further develop my software development, teamworking and communication skills, all which in my opinion, were improved significantly after working with the wonderful team at Micro Software Designs during the last internship. As stated, I would be happy with either the 6 week or 12 week option, but if given the opportunity to choose I would prefer the 12 week option so I can have the full experience. Thank you for your time and consideration.
 
Sincerely,

I am confident that my skills are well – aligned and that I would be a motivated, self – directed and enthusiastic contender for the Internship Programme. My ongoing Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science have ensured that I gain the necessary skills required to become an IT professional. However, I have not yet had the ability to make a positive contribution with what I have learnt. As a young individual who will soon enter the world of work, I am of the belief that valuable skills are not only gained in what is being taught but the application of this knowledge. Therefore, my application would stand to support this notion, and aid in allowing me to acquire the real – life experience and skills required in the development of my professional career.
Additionally, I am proactive, value good workmanship and believe that I possess the qualities to become a strong asset to any company. I also have excellent time management skills and can balance heavy workloads without compromise. This is reflected in my degree transcript as with the ongoing situation, I have managed to attain good grades and a cumulative GPA of 3.77. This is all due to my time management and adaptability skills, which allows me to be flexible in dynamic situations or situations where unexpected change occurs. Thus, I am confident that I can use my knowledge to support ongoing activities and client objectives as part of any team.
In retrospect, I view this as an opportunity to make a positive contribution while developing my interpersonal skills in a professional setting, which sets it apart from the classroom. I hope that I am afforded this opportunity as I believe myself to be an ideal student who would make a positive impact in the workplace with my skills and knowledge.

Michael Tai 
Year 3 – B.Sc. Computer Science with Management
The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine

	I am very much interested in this internship and trusts that my knowledge and experience from my studies would prove to be beneficial for the role assigned to me in this organization. If I were to be chosen, I believe that this internship would help both the company and myself to flourish.
	This essay is written to support my application for a summer internship in the field of computer science and information technology. I am currently pursuing a degree in B.Sc. Computer Science with Management at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine campus. My fascination for computer science started in secondary school when I was first exposed to software applications through CSEC Information Technology. Having relishing in what I had learnt from Information Technology in CSEC, I yearned to know more about modern technology and opted to further my knowledge with CAPE computer science. 
	Initially, it was tough trying to balance between studying for exams, deadlines to assignments, bonding with my family, co-curricular activities (CIC Management Team and St. Mary’s College Computer Society) and my part-time work during my time as a form six student. However, by being patient and disciplined, I managed my time schedule appropriately allowing me to quickly adapt to the routine and successfully passed my CAPE examinations. While working towards receiving my CAPE diploma, I was given a choice upon completion of my secondary school life: either to join the work force or further my studies to enhance my knowledge and career. I decided on the latter option and began my undergraduate degree at the University of the West Indies, St Augustine campus in 2018. 
	During my studies, I came to understand that computer science is a vast and ever-changing field in itself that interacts with many other fields such as business, agriculture, or medicine. It is constantly evolving to cater for the modern day needs of human society and in turn it forces us to think about the social and economic problems that may arise with it as society progresses to challenge the rapid advancements in technology. These problems seek to be analyzed, to be understood and solutions created in a structured manner to solve them. This prospect of analysis, comprehension and application of logical solutions to problems is fun and intriguing as it incites in me my critical thinking skills which not only impacts how I solve technological problems but also non-technological problems. 
	My intentions in this internship is to broaden my horizon in order to understand how business organizations make use of computer science to develop new technologies for solving problems in the modern world. I would like to be exposed to the processes within a firm and learn how to work with and interact in an organizational structure as well as its underlying technologies and systems. 
	I speculate that this internship would be the ideal opportunity for me to sharpen my skills and knowledge while gaining new experiences in applying them to real world situations.

To whom it may concern, 
I view every situation as an opportunity to learn and my believe is that through altruistic means I can make any situation better. Problems are where my passion lies. Technology and Computer science are the frontiers of problem solving and my passion is in understanding and processing problems to create sophisticated and enduring solutions.
In my first degree I pursued an area of science where the problems are numerous and ubiquitous, Environmental Science and found that the problem was people’s habits and capitalistic needs. In pursuit of my solution, I did my second degree in Computer Science because technology had the power to rewrite behaviours and inspire people to change. 
Being selected for this program would give me the opportunity to learn more about the field I am studying in and how I can combine these ideas to create a positive impact on the world around me. 
I am grateful for any opportunity afforded to me, thank you for your time and consideration.

If you are looking for a self-motivated, personable, and dedicated student with excellent interpersonal skills and a strong sense of commitment to their duties, look no further. I am confident that you will find my skills and qualifications to be a strong match with your needs. My academic coursework, leadership experience, and communication skills have prepared me well for this position. 
                I am currently in my second year at the University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, completing a BSc in Computer Science and Management. I strongly believe this internship opportunity would give me further exposure needed to advance my career as an internship can be used as a steppingstone into a lifelong career. As an ambitious individual who adapts quickly to change, I am fully prepared to give my uttermost potential to this job. As President of my secondary school’s interact club, I have coordinated a beach clean-up as well as a flood drive with my Principal and teachers which allowed my communication as well as time management skills to be developed. I continuously try to outshine my previous accomplishments and better myself as an individual and an older sibling. Furthermore, I seek to understand the challenges of the job and will do my best at my given tasks. I will be more than happy to share my skills and knowledge with my mentors and reduce their workload while utilizing the knowledge of their many years of experience.
	            I am an independent thinker who will look for new ways to enhance the business such as identifying sales opportunities through technology via social media and other ecommerce methods, implement and integrate technology into the business process, collect data, perform business studies and make the necessary technological recommendations as well as communicating with clients to ensure the hands-on service they need in order to turn them into repeat customers. I will also exercise due care when engaging in business activities having grasped the concept of business law from my studies at UWI.
	  As you would see from my resume, I try not to limit myself to only academics but many other fields to become the holistic individual to contribute my full potential to my job. While my work experience is limited currently, I believe I possess positive qualities that can be an asset to wherever I am placed. I have no doubt that my unmatched enthusiasm and eagerness to learn can take the internship to new heights.
	I am very much interested to put my abilities to use and hope that we can schedule an interview sometime during the next few weeks. I have attached my resume, which further details my skills and involvement in the community. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about my background.

So far, I've always took opportunities to get involved in internships or programs that would give me any experience in my area of study. I've had experience as a System Support Officer in Scotiabank's IT department, and this taught me about the support side of Information Technology. It involved me going to users and help resolve issues with their system. At the internship they also exposed me to the backbone of their system setup where active directory was used to manage their users and groups. Additionally, I was exposed to their server-client architecture and was trained on how it worked and functioned. My other major experience was at Shell's IT department where I was made privy to almost all subsections of their IT department which comprised of support, quality assurance and equipment management, just to name a few. These experiences helped me apply all my school learnings in a practical manner which I was elated for. Along with all these experiences, I'm well skilled in 7 programming languages.

I am currently pursuing a BSc. Computer Science (Special). When I first heard about this internship, I was in my first year which means I was not qualified to enroll. Now that I am eligible, I am quite excited to apply.
I have always been able to work well with others. I am a team player. I work well under pressure and am always able to meet deadlines. I can carry myself professionally in a workplace. Having been class representative a couple times as well as the chairperson for the Staff/Student Liaison Meeting, I am responsible, respectful to lecturers and tutors, and always happy to be of assistance where I can. Overall, I work hard to do what needs to be done and to get it done to the best of my ability. My previous work experiences include a Summer internship with Airports Authority of Trinidad and Tobago in the department of Human Resources. Having worked in this department, I was able to be at the center of everything and to understand the responsibilities of an HR department. Although I was not placed in the Information Technology department which is where I would have liked to have been, I learned a lot about working in a professional environment. I know I can take my job seriously because in order to work in the Airports Authority of Trinidad and Tobago, each person must prepare for and pass an exam about airport safety protocols and the like, and I did so with flying colors. At the end of the internship program, I received compliments and a great evaluation by my superior. 
I am currently in my third year and so I am verse in programming languages like C/C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Java, SQL. I enjoy problem solving and researching new concepts and applying them. Throughout this degree, I have had many ups and downs, but I have always learned from my mistakes and never made the same one twice. In areas where I struggled the first time, I made sure to excel the second.
No one is without flaws and I have some weaknesses. I always struggled with confrontation. I am generally a very shy person and it is difficult for me to ask questions or approach someone for clarity. However, I have been working on that. I have taught myself to speak up when I need to and ask questions when I need to. Although, I am not an outgoing person I have worked hard to be a better communicator and I am still pushing myself to continue to work on it. 
Being selected for this internship would be an amazing opportunity for me to put into practice concepts I have learned throughout this degree program. I would be able to further develop my interpersonal skills and gain more experience working in a professional setting and as a team. With my eyes on my future, this opportunity can offer me another steppingstone to bring me closer to where I want to be in life.",,T&T Trinidad,Shania Resume1.docx (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5f36a7e46bb6c4d285287246f6085d97/2d90cb1f/ShaniaResume1.docx),

Data science and mobile development are the special interests I have developed while reading for my degree. My enthusiasm stems from finding patterns in data to optimize not only profits but also UX and UI designs. My detail oriented and enduring personality helps me to achieve the goal of aesthetic and efficient designs. I strongly believe that a well-designed system can optimize and increase a company’s profit.

It is in my experience interfacing with the website a company puts forward, shapes the way a person perceives of a company. A poor design with clashing colors and numerous clicks to find information suggests the company is not as efficient or business oriented and it should be. This ideology is translated into my work and personal life. I contemplate how a user would view me and I always strive to be the most useful person in any room. 

 I am always willing to learn and evolve to be the advantageous and productive whether it is in the domain of profits or design. Teamwork and a strong work ethic allow me to accomplish all my goals. I hope the opportunity for us to work together presents itself because I am willing and consistent worker.

To Whom It May Concern,
	I am greatly enthused by the upcoming DCIT internship programme. As a second-year student, to be afforded such an experience is a rare and invaluable opportunity.
	The field of computer science consists of a multitude of possibilities. The vast array of practical, real-world applications invigorates my love for this subject. I enjoy learning about how technology can enhance our livelihoods, better our national security systems, care for medical patients and educate our youth for generations.
	Through teaching science at a primary school level, I understand just how important practical application is to gain full comprehension of what one has learnt in the classroom. I am a lively student with large amounts of energy to spare, stories to motivate and lessons to learn. A natural-born and competitive cheerleader, my goal is to develop my country of Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean at large in the realms of cybersecurity, health informatics, and technologies to advance our criminal justice system.
	These may seem like far-reaching goals, but through in-classroom learning and the ability to work alongside great minds via the internship programme, I believe that I will be equipped with the tools to further my academic career and thereby help facilitate the technological advancement of the Caribbean community.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

I am submitting my resume for consideration in the DCIT summer internship program for the year 2020/2021.. Currently, I am a Year II student pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. As an undergraduate with a 3.8 GPA with leadership experience as well as strong problem solving, communication and team building skills, I am convinced that I am the driven, self-directed and passionate emerging professional that you are seeking. 

To begin, I am a well-rounded individual with not only a solid academic portfolio but also an athletic background. Over the years, I have competed in team sports such as lawn and table tennis, cricket, and football. These sports required me to develop crucial communication and team building skills to motivate my teammates toward the collective goal of the team. Not only did these sports hone my skills as a proficient and motivated member of a team but also allowed my leadership skills to thrive in these competitive environments. Between 2014 and 2017, I led Lakshmi Girls’ Hindu College’s Table tennis team alongside Coach Linda Partap-Boodan. This experience, that earned me the school’s Leadership Award in the field, required discipline and persistence in leading the other teammates which I believe would be a great asset in driving the company towards its goals.

Moreover, during sixth form I participated in two major national competitions - National Secondary School Entrepreneurship Competition and Young Innovators Mobile App Competition (2018) – where I was nominated as project lead in both instances. In both events, not only was my skills as a motivated and driven leader crucial to leading both teams to the finals but these roles demanded individuals to think creatively but critically in a short time span that allowed my critical and problem-solving skills to flourish in such a highly competitive environment.

Despite not obtaining a significant amount of professional experience, a great amount of my time is usually spent managing the family business – Ali’s Woodworks Company Ltd. For the last 6 years, I was trained in managing employees, resolving conflict arising with clients and suppliers and assisting customers during sales. This ongoing experience has not only given me insight into the business world but developed crucial communication skills that are required in solving issues that arrive in the workplace. My time here has not only furthered the company’s status as a reputable entity but also strengthened its relationship between customers and employees. Additionally, I am often given the role of managing the company’s financials which includes balancing the company’s books and issuing payments. This allowed me to learn the importance of integrity, accountability and structure within an organization which would prove beneficial to any of the participating company in this program. 

Further to this, in my spare time I also develop my passion for graphic design. Over the last two years, I spent some of time designing posters, signs, logos, flyers and business cards. My most recent published piece was a poster advertising the Counselling and Psychological Services Department (CAPS) youth group at UWI St Augustine where it was shared across the campus and online. Graphic design allows me to harness my creative ability to produce ideas and solutions that are unique. In a modern, technologically advanced environment where there are usually many solutions to a problem, the ability to differentiate oneself is crucial to any individual or company in the professional world. As a result, I think these creative, problem-solving skills would be an asset to any company that is seeking to distinguish themselves in the modern world. 
Lastly, as an individual always prepared for a challenge, I believe that this program would offer the opportunities and challenges that would be beneficial to both myself as a budding professional and the companies seeking new ideas and fresh minds to accomplish their goals. I am of the belief that with my skills, passion and drive I would be a great addition to your team.
 
I appreciate you taking the time to review my application and I hope you consider granting me this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you.

Throughout my childhood years, I was always intrigued by the innerworkings of computers. Then, during my time at secondary school, I was introduced to Information Technology in Form 2 which added to my interest. That was the beginning of my relationship with programming. My knowledge and fascination expanded and as such, I decided that I had to pursue it further. So, I did. I did Information Technology for CSEC and then Computer Science for CAPE. My love for programming blossomed into wanting this to be my career path. My decision about what to further my studies in tertiary level became an easy one and I started my current degree in Computer Science at The University of The West Indies, St. Augustine campus. 
Now, if I said that this programme has been easy for me, I would be lying because it has been anything but. My first semester was everything I expected and wanted but the next semester I was hit with the reality of what the rest of the degree would be. I struggled a fair bit during my second year due to a combination of both personal and environmental factors, but it was last semester, in my third year, that I really rediscovered my appreciation for the subject. 
Over the past three years, I have learnt more than just Computer Science. I had the opportunity to develop my teamwork, leadership, and interpersonal skills through the many group projects as well as through being a class representative. I was also able to improve my problem solving and programming skills in various languages like C++, Python and Java to name a few. My goal is to be a software developer or website designer after I complete my degree.  I think this internship programme is the ideal opportunity for me to gain some experience and work on achieving that goal. My work experience thus far has allowed a glimpse into the working world and I am eager to learn more and contribute to whichever organisation that I can.",,T&T Trinidad,"""Danielle Charles, Bsc Computer Science (Special).pdf (https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e2e2f8af0df7af6512b6b834e51c1155/6eea1e8e/DanielleCharlesBscComputerScienceSpecial.pdf)""",

I should be chosen for the programme because I am extremely versatile when it comes to software development. I have worked on several projects ranging from eCommerce to machine learning. From working on those projects I have learnt how to use several technologies like ReactNative, Angular, Ionic, Tensorflow, Android Studio and Firebase.

Other than the personal projects I have worked on, I do have real world experience to bring to the table. Most particularly working at corporate dynamic limited doing graphic work and helping with their website design in their no code environment. Most recently I have been working for Dr. Phaedra Mohammed on the indexing of  
Lise Winer's Dictionary of the English/Creole of Trinidad & Tobago. I believe these experiences have given me a sufficient understanding of real world work ethic which can be applied to the DCIT internship.

Consistency is my core strength, and I've shown that by my diverse portfolio of projects. I am adaptable and learn new technologies quickly. Currently, I have little to show for the 3 years I've been a student. This internship will allow me to gain more experience, knowledge and help expand my portfolio. I should be chosen because of my adaptability and consistency shown by learning new technologies, and because I am continuously trying to gain more experience in my field.

Dear Internship Team,
Firstly, I would like to thank you for this opportunity. I am aware that actual industry experience provides an indispensable asset to any Computer Science student. As a Year Two student I am quite keen on using and further developing my skills in a professional environment. 
I believe that my strong academic background, adaptability, and communication skills will allow me to produce a tangible and positive contribution. As shown by my attached transcript and resume I have a strong foundation in my coursework which I believe can be molded via an internship to  practical experience that shall benefit not only me, but also the company I work under.
However, it is medically inadvisable for me to pursue an in-house internship currently due to the pandemic. This may change in the future once vaccinations begin but the time-frame for that is not yet finalized. A fully remote internship would be preferred, but I understand if this may not be possible. 
Once again, thank you for your time and the opportunity presented. Even if I do not qualify for an internship this summer, I will gladly consider this a valuable learning experience. Feel free to contact me if required and have a great day.

Through my time at the university, as well as past job sites, I have acquired a vast array of knowledge based and interpersonal skills.  
U.W.I. has equipped me with a diverse understanding of many of the domains Information Technology encompasses. It has exposed me to and expanded my interest in, various programming languages, web technologies, networking concepts and information systems.  It has also encouraged me to become more structured and strategic in the way I approach my work and spend my time in keeping with deadlines. These have strengthened my preparedness for working environments that demand the same of me. 
In addition to the knowledge I’ve acquired in my studies, I have also worked in the retail and event management industries. I have worked at Micles Fashion Company and I am currently employed part-time with an event management and decorating company, L.A. Specialty Greetings. Through these experiences I have had the opportunity to engage with professionals, peers and customers and find creative solutions in fast paced and dynamic environments. I believe this demonstrates my versatility and broad set of skills which is crucial when entering and adapting to a new working environment.
My eagerness to take part in this year’s internship stems from the fulfilling experience I had in last year’s internship. I was fortunate to be chosen to represent DCIT for First Citizen’s Internship Program 2020. I was assigned to the Group Strategic and Corporate Planning Unit where I was tasked with creating a dashboard that would visually summarize survey results to aid in executive decision making and engage in the planning and design phases of a survey administration system. I was not only able to leverage the knowledge gained at university, but I also gained experiences interacting with management and stakeholders and insight into business processes and operations.
As I conclude my degree program and prepare to officially step out into the world of work, an internship will give me the opportunity of to bridge that gap. I believe my strong educational background, skillset and experience as an intern will equip me with the tools necessary to competently carry out the job requirements of an internship, as well as, be an asset to any organization.
